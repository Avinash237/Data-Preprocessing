# Data-Preprocessing
Data Prepossessing is the first stage of building a machine learning model. It involves transforming raw data into an understandable format for the analysis by a machine learning model. It is a crucial stage and should be done properly. A well-prepared dataset will give the best prediction by the model.
Why Data Preprocessing is so Important?

Raw data may contain improper values or in an incorrect format.
Making the dataset feasible for the analysis.
For achieving the best result from a dataset.
Quality result depends on quality data. I.e. improper or missing data can lead a model to give confusing output

Major tasks in Data Preprocessing: The major tasks in Data Preprocessing are given below:

1.Data cleaning: Fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove outliers, and resolve inconsistencies.

2.Data Integration: Integration of multiple databases, data cubes, or files.

3.Data Transformation: Normalization and aggregation.
